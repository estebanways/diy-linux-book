I re-added:

squeezelite	(the conflict was with oss version)



After removing these packages the sound card failed, so I will remove from the list, found:

*oss*: 
Old sound before ALSA for old sound cards, remove all related to 'oss'. (You can install newest OSS versions, but is stupid
decision because almost everything in Linux currently uses ALSA, I use Jack and pulseaudio)

*-dev: 
I will keep them, because can need them, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1157192/what-do-the-dev-packages-in-the-linux-package-repositories-actually-contain

*-dbg: 
I can keep them  due to:  https://wiki.debian.org/DebugPackage

ffmpeg:
There is avconv as fork, see:  https://wiki.debian.org/ffmpeg
ffmpeg and avconv co-exist for now.
ffmpeg was a backport in jessie but is a package in Stretch, see: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=ffmpeg&searchon=names&suite=stable&section=all
$ apt-cache search avconv
output:
libav-tools - Compatibility links for libav-tools (transitional package)
mkchromecast - Cast your Linux audio to your Google Cast devices
winff - graphical video and audio batch converter using ffmpeg or avconv
winff-data - winff data files
winff-doc - winff documentation
end of.
$ apt-cache search libav-tools
output:
libav-tools - Compatibility links for libav-tools (transitional package)
end of.
$ apt-cache search ffmpeg
output
(... the existent list in v.0.0.1)
end of.
As a result I excluded all or next libav libs and removed ffmpeg section (but keeping apps), to install
only automatic and recommends using:
$ apt-get install ffmpeg
$ apt-get install libav-tools

pulseaudio:
$apt-cache search pavucontrol:
output:
pavucontrol-qt-l10n - Language package for pavucontrol-qt
pasystray - PulseAudio controller for the system tray
pavucontrol - PulseAudio Volume Control
pavucontrol-dbg - Debugging symbols for pavucontrol
pavucontrol-qt - Qt port of volume control pavucontrol
end of.
First two are not in the packages lists, but I think they're not required.

compat: 
Compatibility, the only I removed from the list was compatibility alsa-oss
and probably pulseaudio-oss


gstreamer:
This section has many packages, I am installing averything available
but if something fails I have to double check this list.

mp4:
Overview complete, but same case of gstreamer

mp3:
Overview complete, but same case of gstreamer

wav:
Overview complete, but same case of gstreamer

vlc:
Overview complete, but same case of gstreamer

l10n:
translations packages. Do not remove.

edu:
I preserved debian "edu" these packages in the list to create my pure blend based on it
EG: debian-edu-artwork-softwaves
(and docs packages)
Package in debian web: https://packages.debian.org/stretch/debian-edu-artwork-softwaves
List of files: https://packages.debian.org/stretch/all/debian-edu-artwork-softwaves/filelist
Need to install: plymouth - boot animation, logger and I/O multiplexer
To complete the pure blend you need to create themes to the desktops environments (CINAMMOM, GNOME, XFCE, LXDE, KDE),
so the apps will look pieces of the theme.. but also you can create themes for apps or recompile them with changes,
the most difficult part.

(CINAMMOM, GNOME, XFCE, LXDE, KDE):
I require to include these packages in the list to create my pure blend
