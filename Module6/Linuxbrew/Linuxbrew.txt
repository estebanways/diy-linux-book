Linuxbrew allows us to fetch, install from source and keep up to date the all tools and technologies available on Homebrew.

There are optional projects to Homebrew for Mac, for example the MacPorts project.
Reference: https://www.macports.org/

The Homebrew perspective excludes Windows Machines from the most of the Web developments based on Mac libraries, because they are unable to install their Unix sources from Homebrew. Poor Windows users must uninstall and re-install manually the AVAILABLE, new as possible .exe program version.

You know Linuxbrew is not the only repo source you need to complete your Development project; I am going to add Ruby, NPM, Grunt, some Git sources and, last but not least, APT. Sometimes you should decide between two sources to install from. In those cases match the advantages and the disadvantages of every one, like interactions, dependencies and versions before you take the final decision on what to install and use.
In summary search:
For Formulas, on LinuxBrew
For packages, on NPM
For packages, on Bower
For gems, on Ruby
For contribs, on Grunt
For sources, on Git
For system apps, on APT

Installation of dependencies:

Ruby:
I believe the best way to start from is to take the advantage of the existing Ruby on the system to install LinuxBrew and deal with the Ruby versioning later.

Curl:
I also decided to use it with Ruby, because Curl has the option "l" which is Wget unavailable. Curl is on my system since the installation of Conky, and seems LinuxBrew installable, but I can't install it from LinuxBrew no LinuxBrew on the system yet. You can choose to install Curl from APT, just because the program is not required to Develop, and I am not developing yet. I can try to install Curl from LinuxBrew after the installation of LinuxBrew.
Reference:
Web: http://braumeister.org/formula/curl
To install Curl from the Official Debian sources:
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install curl

Git:
This has not been used yet. At first I wanted to install it later from LinuxBrew to preserve the Mac compatibility, but later on realized that I need it as dependency to get done the LinuxBrew installation no matter if I install from Ruby or Git repos.

Steps:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git m4 ruby texinfo libbz2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat-dev libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev

Linuxbrew installation:
I am not gonna use Git right now but I will show you the command to fetch and install LinuxBrew using Git: $ git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew.git ~/.linuxbrew

I install Linuxbrew from Ruby:
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)"

Output:
==> This script will install:
/home/esteban/.linuxbrew/bin/brew
/home/esteban/.linuxbrew/Library/...
/home/esteban/.linuxbrew/share/man/man1/brew.1

Install the Linuxbrew dependencies:

Debian, Ubuntu, etc.:
  `sudo apt-get install build-essential`

Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, etc.:
  `sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'`

See http://brew.sh/linuxbrew/#dependencies for more information.

Run `brew doctor` before you install anything
Run `brew help` to get started

Add these environment variables to your .bashrc file:
export PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
export MANPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH"
export INFOPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH"

Reload your file bashrc no logout required:
References:
Web: http://superuser.com/questions/174943/running-bashrc-versus-new-login
There are three methods to re-read the file:
Method 1:
"exec bash" should do it. Basically just restarts the bash shell, reading .bashrc in the process.
Method 2:
You can source the file using ".":
$ . ~/.bashrc
Method 3:
You can source the file using source:
$ source ~/.bashrc
That will re-read and execute the lines in the file in the current session.

Review the variables exported:
$ env
$ env $PATH
$ echo $MANPATH

$ which brew
/home/ubuntu/.linuxbrew/bin/brew

Update LinuxBrew:
$ brew update
Always update before search. This feature of Brew works like APT.
