LightDM is a free and open-source X display manager that aims to be lightweight, fast, extensible and multi-desktop. It can use various front-ends to draw the user interface,[6] also called Greeters. It also supports Wayland.

$ sudo nala install lightdm

$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm

Choose Lightdm as the display manager.

Close and choose KDE (Plasma) from the LightDM menu to start a Wayland session instead of a X Server session.

To verify that you are using Wayland in the system:
Search for "About" in the applications search field.
