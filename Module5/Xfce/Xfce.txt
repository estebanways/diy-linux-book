Install the Xfce Desktop Environment

Now we are going to install basic Xfce & goodies by running the following command:
sudo apt-get install xfce4-* xfce4-goodies

The “Goodies for Xfce” project includes additional software and artwork that are related to the Xfce desktop, but not part of the official release.
To view the list of packages installed by xfce4-goodies, check this link, https://packages.debian.org/jessie/xfce4-goodies.

Install Xfce packages:
Add main section to the official repos:
$ apt-cache show xfce4
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.lit
Update repos:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ apt-cache search xfce4
Everything available:
$ sudo apt-get install `apt-cache search xfce | cut -d ' ' -f1`
This command is going to install lightdm, a Display Manager. To change the Display Manager, see the guide "Change the default login screen"

To change the Window Manager you can run the Compix-Fusion Icon or update-alternatives:
$ sudo update alternatives --config -x-window-manager

Guide: Compiz-Fusion

During the configuration of the Desktop the Compiz-Fusion Icon could get fail. To defrost it kill it until everything is all right to add the icon to the startup sequence:
$ pkill fusion-icon

To add the Compiz-Fusion Icon to the startup applications go to the Applications Menu > Settings > Settings Manager > Sessions and Startup > Application Autostart
