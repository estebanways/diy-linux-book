Aptana Studio is a complete Development Studio for Python, Ruby, PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

I appreciated much a few features it has, like the.. SVN Plugin, and the tool to review differences between file versions. Aptana Studio 3 is based on Eclipse, and is good to program PHP like Netbeans. Aptana Studio 3 comes with Java embedded (Hotspot), so you don't need to install Java at all. But, well Java is actually running on the system.

Installation steps:
Download site: http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3/download.html
Copy the compressed file to /opt. This file is a pre-compiled directory which works without any compilation after the extraction, as the program Sublime Text Editor.
# cp -dpR Aptana_Studio_3_Setup_Linux_x86_64_3.6.1.zip /opt
# unzip Aptana_Studio_3_Setup_Linux_x86_64_3.6.1.zip
Fix the permission as the other applications in this directory:
# ls -hal
# chmod 755 Aptana_Studio_3
# cd Aptana_Studio_3
Run the program. Change to user:
$ ./AptanaStudio3
You can modify the permissions of the directory to allow or block other system users from using the Studio.
Create the symlink to the program:
$ sudo ln -s /opt/Aptana_Studio_3/AptanaStudio3 /usr/bin/AptanaStudio3
After that to execute use:
$ AptanaStudio3
Add the program to the Main Menu in Gnome.
Icon: /opt/Aptana_Studio_3/icon.xpm
