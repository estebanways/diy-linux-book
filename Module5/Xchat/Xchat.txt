Install x-chat:
# apt-get update
# apt-get install xchat

Start the program in the menu and look for the freenode.

Don't use the program or use it through a network like Tor because other users can see your IP and attempt to attack you.

If you want to set up Xchat as server use SSL certified connections within your teams.
