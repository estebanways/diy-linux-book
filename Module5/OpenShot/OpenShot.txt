Warning: I stopped using OpenShot as the Jessie version crashed, at least using Oracle Java, but curiously the video playback works better with Oracle Java than the with Open Java version. I replaced OpenShot with Kdelive. See the sections: 
KDE Desktop Environment
KXStudio
Cinelerra

With Openshot you have almost all the features in a lightweight editor, I.E. effects and transitions, non linear edition with many audio and video channels you can add to render great movies in many formats like mp4 for YouTube.

You can use synaptic and search for the package openshot, otherwise use APT.

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install openshot

To launch the program:
$ openshot
$ openshot &
$ openshot [filename]

I also recommend that you install Inkscape, a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) editor. Inkscape allows you to edit Titles in OpenSHOT. SVG comes by default with the Gnome desktop environment, but just in case:
$ sudo apt-get install inkscape

If has not been installed yet in the system the OpenSHOT installation downloads hte latest version of OpenJDK (Free Java) as a dependency in Debian Wheezy. However, Thank God! it is not happening in Jessie. In Wheezy, I required to remove or switch from OpenJDK to Oracle JDK. In my experience, openshot works a little bit better with the Oracle version in Wheezy.

Note: There is a minimal java runtime installation running no full java in the Jessie system:
$ dpkg -l | grep 'java'

To choose from Java versions, see guide: Java

Issues:
Openshot hanged up in my 64bit Debian. Some people say that there is aproblem with dependency libraries you can replace. However, did not replaced anything and chosen to install a more professional video edition software such as Cinelerra and Kdenlive.
