An then,  rerun the command to install the mono dependencies and other dependencies.
To install hubic as filesystem integration in the user space, from the Official Debian repositories (Support for mounting Hubic drive):
# apt-get install hubicfuse
This is the GitHub to download the hubic token:
Web: https://github.com/TurboGit/hubicfuse
Download the ZIP.
Unzip the file:
$ unzip hubicfuse-master.zip
Find the file hubic_token and copy it to Documents:
$ cp -dpR hubic_token /home/esteban/Documents
Assign execution permissions for the file:
$ chmod +x  hubic_token
Execute the file:
$ sh hubic_token
Enter the information requested, in accordance with your application information on the web site: 
Web: https://hubic.com/en/
Log in and then go the section My Account > Developers.
Under Developers Click on Herrera Cloud.
After that, answer the following questions entering the character in parenthesis:
For the scope -what you authorize your app to do-, enter characters as suggested in parenthesis, or just hit return if you don't need the item authorized.
Get account usage (r): 
Get all published links in one call (r): 
Get OpenStack credentials, eg. access to your files (r): 
Send activation email (w): 
Add new/Get/Delete published link (wrd): 
Next, copy the message returned. Something like:
# Here is what your app needs to connect to hubiC:
client_id=api_hubic_C24sTNNNNxxxxx999999TTTTTssssZZZ
client_secret=AAAAAAbbbbbbbbb1111111111ccccccccc222222222222DDDDDDDDeeeee33333ffff
refresh_token=gggggYYYYYYLLLLLL8888888ffffffaaaaalllllleee555555555eeeeeeeeeNNNNN444 
Next, create a new file which is going to include the information copied.
$ sudo nano /root/.cloudfuse
Add the next information and save changes:
username=my_hubic_email@server.com
password=MyhubicPASS
client_id=api_hubic_C24sTNNNNxxxxx999999TTTTTssssZZZ
client_secret=AAAAAAbbbbbbbbb1111111111ccccccccc222222222222DDDDDDDDeeeee33333ffff
refresh_token=gggggYYYYYYLLLLLL8888888ffffffaaaaalllllleee555555555eeeeeeeeeNNNNN444
redirect_uri= http://localhost/
verify_ssl=True
Back-up the file:
$ sudo cp -dpR .cloudfuse /home/esteban/Documents/.cloudfuseBAK
Mount the storage service somewhere, for example /mnt:
$ sudo hubicfuse /mnt  -o noauto_cache,sync_read,allow_other,umask=0007
Go to /mnt:
$ cd /mnt
The new directory 'default' is going to appear.
Every reboot the cloud directory has to be re-mounted. It is not possible to add this mount point to the file /etc/fstab because mounting precedes networking. To mount the cloud directory when the system starts create a systemd service. Remember to setup the drive/file read and write permissions depending on your needs. See the systemd guide for details.

To add the drive to Nautilus (Files):
Open nautilus
In the main manu go to Bookmarks
Add /mnt/default as Herrera Cloud Drive
Test the drive synchronization adding an image and verifying the synchronization on the hubic web site.
Now, it is time to sync a local directory in the cloud:
Download the (beta version) file from:
Web: http://mir7.ovh.net/ovh-applications/hubic/hubiC-Linux/2.1.0/
Install the package:
$ sudo dpkg -i hubiC-Linux-2.1.0.53-linux.deb
Create the local directory to sync, for example "Documents":
$ mkdir ~/MyLocalHubic
Use the service:
$ hubic login my_email@server.com ~/MyLocalHubic
Add files to the folder. The service will start to sync the folder rapidly. If you have the hubic cloud drive in /mnt a second copy of the files sync are going to be saved under default/.
Note that sync a local directory in the hubiC Cloud is fast meanwhile the support for mounting a Hubic drive is slow. The service is very useful to sync files in many devices, for example, a desktop computer, a tablet and a smartphone.

Test the Hubic Indicator Gnome Shell Extension:
Topic: Look for the section: "Install Hubic Indicator extension:". You can pause sync and go ahead later on.
