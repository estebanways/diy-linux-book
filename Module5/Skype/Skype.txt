This web site the current status of Skype for Debian, and redirects me to the Official Skype web site to download the package: http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/

I choose Debian as Distro to download the proper file.

When the file has been downlaoded, install it.
$ sudo dpkg -i skype-debian_4.3.0.37-1_i386.deb

You'll notice the dependencies problem. You have to enable 32 bit architecture due to there is not 64 bit package available at this moment. I have already show how to add the 32 bit architecture in the installation of teamviewer, here:

Teamviewer
Multi Architecture

Run again the installation:
$ sudo dpkg -i skype-debian_4.3.0.37-1_i386.deb

The installation is going to fail due to the program cannot find some dependencies required.
Install these dependencies (If you are not 100% sure of where you are going to fetch files from, take a look at your file /etc/apt/sources.list and run # apt-get update before continue).
$ sudo apt-get -f install

Rerun the installation command. Don't worry, we are up to finish.
Open skype, set it up and enjoy it with your friends.
$ skype
