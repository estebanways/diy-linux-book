Compiz is not comptible with Gnome 3, so don't run Compiz in this Desktop Environment. In case of you want to use Gnome you can use a newer Desktop like Mate, a evolution of Gnome 2.

I personally use the Compiz-Fusion plugins to create the cube virtual desktops, in XFCE and LXDE, for example. The problem with these Destops is that, at least in Debian, they don't support my USB headset, which I love to make web video conferences and record my voice, digitally instead of analogically, of course.

I hope that the XFCE and LXDE maintainers notice these kind of problems and send me a solution.

If you can't enable the fusion icon or see windows titles:
After all, remove the Desktop configuration files or directories of the current user such as /home/esteban/.config/xfce4, for Xfce:
$ cd
$ rm -rf ./config/xfce
Log out and log in the session to load a new default desktop configuration, turn on the fusion icon, and then choose Compiz as your Window Manager.


Compiz-Fusion can overheat the computer, especially laptops and notebooks. Use 'sensors' to monitor the temperature and disable what you need.
