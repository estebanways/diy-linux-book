Download 32 package and follow the steps:

For the 64-bit package:
# dpkg -i teamviewer_linux_x64.deb

In case “dpkg” indicates missing dependencies, complete the installation by executing the following command:
# apt-get update
# apt-get install -f

Notes to Multiarch:
On newer 64-bit DEB-systems with Multiarch-support (Debian 7) teamviewer_linux_x64.deb cannot be installed because the package ia32-libs is not available anymore on these systems. In this case you can use teamviewer_i386.deb instead.

In case you get the error “wrong architecture i386” you have to execute the following command lines as an administrator:
# dpkg --add-architecture i386
# apt-get update
Note: At this point I have installed Debian multiarchitecture to support 32 bit programs.
Install the 32 bit:
# dpkg -i teamviewer_10.0.37742_i386.deb
Note:
At this point the system says that there is a dependency error an I re-run before installation:
# apt-get install -f

Run teamviewer as user:
$ teamviewer
