The file will open using the default system editor, E.g.: nano.

To change the editor for terminal:

Make Neovim the terminal editor.

Notes:
The installation adds Vim as a dependency, and if you have Neovim installed, Vim is not going to work as expected if it is executed, unless you remove the symbolic link from the ~/.vimrc file.
