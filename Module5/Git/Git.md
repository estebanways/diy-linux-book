## Installation on Debian 11 codename Bullseye

Steps:

If you have a previous git version installed. This could affect somehow git repositories using too old git versions, so proceed with caution, document the versions used up to now, and make backup copies of your development repos, and source repos used/installed before continue.

```shell
sudo apt-get remove git
sudo apt autoremove
```

Update the repos:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
```

Install build dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt install make libssl-dev libghc-zlib-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext unzip
```

Output:

```output
The following additional packages will be installed:
ghc libbsd-dev libffi-dev libgmp-dev libgmpxx4ldbl libmd-dev libncurses-dev
libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev

```

Get the version of Git you would like to install by visiting the Git project’s mirror on GitHub, available via the following URL: <https://github.com/git/git>

The current latest version available is 2.36-rc1, but it is a release candidate, so let's download another one, like this:

```shell
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/refs/tags/v2.35.1.zip -O git.zip
```

Unzip the file downloaded:

```shell
unzip git.zip
```

Enter the directory:

```shell
cd git-*
```

Make the package:

```shell
make prefix=/usr/local all
```

Install the package:

```shell
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
```

Check version:

```shell
git --version
```
