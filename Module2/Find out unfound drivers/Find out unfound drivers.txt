Most of Windows and Linux drivers a re acompatible with all the main ditributions.
Surprisingly, there are more drives for Linux than for Windows, because the most of Windows drivers are compatible with Linux, but there are many Linux drivers incompatible with Windows.
Think of and treat drivers as if they were software to install, because the most of drivers come as package or inside a package such as DEB, RPM or source code tarballs to build. Also there is a kernel core or module (for example module.ko) to support the device you want to install.

Whether there is not possibility to find a driver suitable for your case in the Official Debian repositories, search for it:
- In the device drivers' vendor/manufacturer CDROM or web site.
- Third driver web sites and FTPs like http://www.linux-drivers.org
- Review the most important distro hardware compatibility lists, like the Ubuntu compatibility list.
- There is always a way, for example, reverse engineering or driver development, otherwise replace the device by a Linux compatible one. Remember to notify the vendor about the problem.
