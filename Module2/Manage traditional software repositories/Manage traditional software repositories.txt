Before any installation using APT follow these steps:

Backup a version of the repositories file:
$ ls /etc/apt
$ sudo cp -dpR /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.listBAK
To create more file versions:
$ sudo cp -dpR /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.listBAK2
Open the repositories file:
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Activate/install only the repos that contain the package to install and its dependecies, usually sections main, contrib and non-free.
Search and find the package:
$ sudo apt-cache search package
Show package information:
$ sudo apt-cache show package
Review the repo section in the repos pool. 
At this point you could need to reopen sources.list or something under /etc/apt/ or /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to activate-deactivate another or more repos. You can also search for packages on www.debian.org to avoid disabling/enabling many times.
Update sources.list, /etc/apt and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ installed repos in the APT database:
$ sudo apt-get update
Finally youa are allowd to install the package:
$ sudo apt install <package-name>


Next is a copy of my file /etc/apt/sources.list, include important information to understand how to use repositories:

# Testing in progress for Debian 8 "Jessie" (These packages were in testing for a 
# while after I installed the newest Debian GNU/Linux Jessie, version 8.0, but later

# Packages: ATI drivers, Steam,
#deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free

# Backports are made to add new functionality to programs, and this sometimes
# involves security.

# Backports are packages taken from the next Debian release (called
# "testing"), adjusted and recompiled for usage on Debian stable.
# Because the package is also present in the next Debian release, you
# can easily upgrade your stable+backports system once the next
# Debian release comes out. (In a few cases, usually for security
# updates, backports are also created from the Debian unstable
# distribution.)
# Backports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and
# backports are provided on an asÂ­is basis, with risk of
# incompatibilities with other components in Debian stable. Use with
# care!
# It is therefore recommended to only select single backported
# packages that fit your needs, and not use all available backports.
# Taken from: http://backports.debian.org/
# You can specify backports in the command line to do not disable the
# Official repos sections main, contrib and non-free, for example:
# $ sudo apt-get install -t wheezy-backports  "package"
# $ sudo aptitude install -t wheezy-backports  "package"
# Remember to type the actual running release to do not make installation 
# mistakes.
# Instructions: http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/

# Official Jessie Backports:
# Packages: ffmpeg (But also Kdenlive, KDE and KXStudio install it as a 
# dependency package),
# deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main

# Some time after the release of Jessie I added the new backports repo. 
# Backports are made to add new functionality to programs, and this sometimes
# involves security.
# Kodi specifications: Starting with Debian Jessie, Debian provides kodi via its 
# backports repository remember that those packages are not supported by team kodi
# Packages: Kodi,
#deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main

# It's a second backports repo I have added:
# Packages: wine-development,
#deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main 

# Sid (no codename) = Unstable Debian:
# Packages: Gnash,
#deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian sid main

# A new configuration for the same sid include non free repos
# Packages: virtualbox-guest-additions-iso 4.3.18-3, tlp,
#deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian sid main non-free

# Install only packages for your distribution realease to avoid damaging your system.
# You could require section conventions to create sandboxes and for virtualization,
# as follows: 
# Use 'stable' (Jessie), 'testing' (Stretch), 'unstable' ("sid", no codename yet) 
# or release-name when looking for old package versions, for example 'Squeeze'

# An Official 'stable' mirror in Denmark just in case:
#deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/pub/debian stable main contrib non-free 

# Unofficial (External) repositories. Proceed carefully:

# Mint repo to install packages. It does not say the type which should mean is stable,
# or more exactly "latest stable" no matter what is the stable release (meanwhile is
# Jessie). No main, contrib or non-free have been specified, which means everything
# is mixed here.
# Packages: Firefox,
#deb http://packages.linuxmint.com debian import

# Deb multimedia repo. This repo is Unofficial and untrusted in the MIT but in their 
# own key servers. Some people recommends not to use it at all)
# Packages: Avidemux(Qt),
#deb http://deb-multimedia.org/ stable main non-free
#deb-src http://deb-multimedia.org/ stable main non-free
# Packages: libvidstab1.0,
#deb http://deb-multimedia.org/ sid main non-free
#deb-src http://deb-multimedia.org/ sid main non-free

# Experimental are repos and packages rather than and considered after the  old-stable, 
# stable, testing and unstable ones.

End of file.

Notes: 
The file does not contain installation repos under /etc/apt/ like KXStudio, or /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ like Compiz-Fusion and Google Chrome.
I don't install everything this way. There are many alternatives to install software in Linux and Debian.
Somethimes you have to decide where from and what version to install, having more than one options available. 
To applications manually downloaded from the Internet I have a separate Repo folder instead of the copy of the cached packages under /var/cache/apt/archives.
