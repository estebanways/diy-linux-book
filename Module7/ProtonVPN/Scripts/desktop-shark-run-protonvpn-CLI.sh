# Protonvpn-cli package for debian (.deb)
# gdebi
# resolvconf
# ProtonVPN user account (Free account works)
# OpenVPN IKEv2 username and password for manual IKEv2 login or
# strongswan, libstrongswan-extra-plugins, and/or libcharon-extra-plugins
# packages, cert, and setup for ipsec and connection to the IKEv2 protocol
# without authentication.

#
# Kill switch:
# A kill switch is a security feature that protects your IP address
# in case you unexpectedly lose the connection to a ProtonVPN server. 
# In case the connection is interrupted, a kill switch blocks all 
# external network traffic to and from your device until the connection
# is automatically re-established to the same VPN server. 
# This means that even though you canâ€™t use the Internet until 
# ProtonVPN reconnects, your IP address and DNS queries are safe
# from being exposed.
protonvpn-cli ks --on
#protonvpn-cli ks --permanent
#protonvpn-cli ks --off
#
# After logging in the first time ProtonVPN stores the password
# but user must be typed in (Estebsnx):
protonvpn-cli login $PROTONVPNUSER
#
# Connect manually to a specific server in the terminal using openvpn:
# Enter credentials from https://account.protonvpn.com/account
# If you want to enable the ProtonVPN ad blocker (NetShield):
# Use: "xSsvYsemgmJUrasdfvvk0Ng+f1" as username to enable anti-malware filtering
# Use: "xSsvYsemgmJUrasdfvvk0Ng+f2" as username to additionally enable ad-blocking filtering.
# Reset the user credential if the current credentials don't work
# The system is going to ask for the sudo password before the authentication
# credentials
#sudo openvpn ~/ProtonVPN_server_configs/jp-free-04.protonvpn.com.tcp.ovpn

# Test connection:

# Verify my VPN Private Network IP address (from the VPN server set up, 
# don't confuse it with a public IP). It also tells us whether yes or not
