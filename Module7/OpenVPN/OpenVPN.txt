OpenVPN is all right to create Private Network, but I insist, this is not very good for certain Desktops, due to you must open Internet ports to share files with your Peer, and by then you will be compromising your system. For example, if you share with a Windows you will need programs to share files from it and/or programs to verify the VPN certificates and OpenVPN for Windows. In the Linux side you will need ClamAV to check the files shared looking for viruses. Anyways, it's good to enforce the VPN with programs like Privoxy (a web proxy with advanced functions, so you require to set up the browsers).

More tools you should use when use OpenVPN:
Dnsmasq. Provides a DNS service to do not use DNS but the DNS cache.
HAVP. This is a proxy with antivirus, scans the traffic looking for viruses and suspicious behaviors.
