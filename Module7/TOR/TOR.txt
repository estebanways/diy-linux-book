- What TOR is about:

TOR (The Onion Router), is the largest implementation of onion routing, which is a method for transmitting data anonymously over the Internet. Run by volunteers, there are approximately a thousand Tor proxy servers on the Internet that provide the routing paths.

- Debian and Tor Services available as Onion Services:

The Debian project is working with the Tor privacy network to set up anonymous access to Debian's infrastructure. "We, the Debian project and the Tor project, are enabling Tor onion services for several of our sites. These sites can now be reached without leaving the Tor network, providing a new option for securely connecting to resources provided by Debian and Tor. The freedom to use open source software may be compromised when access to that software is monitored, logged, limited, prevented, or prohibited. As a community, we acknowledge that users should not feel that their every action is trackable or observable by others. Consequently, we are pleased to announce that we have started making several of the various web services provided by both Debian and Tor available via onion services." A list of Debian services available through the Tor network and how to access them can be found in the announcement.
