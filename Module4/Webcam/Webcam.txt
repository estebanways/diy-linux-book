- Webcam features

When you buy a webcam camera consider next topics:
Is Widescreen?
Megapixels (MPX)
Is HD (High Definition)? IE: 720p HD
Price
Is USB 2.0?
The MIC quality
Are its drivers compatible with Linux or Apple
Zoom, measured in X, IE: 2x, 4x, etc.

- Webcam installation

The webcam and sound must be Linux compatible and ready to support programs like Skype. I hope to hear that every Logitech's camera works.

Select and configure the Webcam with the program Cheese.

I have no problems with this topic but I red some web pages that can help.

- Webcam configuration: Guvcview

The best program that I've found is Guvcview. It is good because there is not Logitech software for Linux. It allows to record, change light options to avoid the image noise and use the zoom. 
TO install:
Add Debian repositories main, contriband nonfree:
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Update the software DBs:
$ sudo apt-get update
Show the repository of the package (and other package information):
$ apt-cache show guvcview
Fetch, install and configure the package and dependencies:
$ sudo apt-get install guvcview

To increase web cam speed when it is slow:
If you experience really low framerate, in order to get the framerate up:
Under the TAB 'Image Control', set the dropdown box value 'Exposure, Auto' to 'Manual Mode', and Decrease Exposure (Absolute) using the correspondent slider. E.G. set up the exposure to 150 should be 15 fps. See FPS changes in the webcam window title. This action is going to decrease the light, and you will need light bulbs or lamps to improve the light of the room or the scene-nary. Always Monitor and control the framerate when apply changes in the other tabs of the software. E.G., Move the Brightness from 0 to -8 or 8 and verify and log what's best value to improve the image. This brighteness does not affect the framerate.

- Webcam configuration: mplayer

mplayer ­ Can be used to view webcam video by invoking mplayer tv://
It is going to install additional requirements for camera color, etc.
it is also the best and easiest way to test the webcam after any installation. 

Installation:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install mplayer
$ mplayer tv://

- Disable the webcam kernel module

This is to avoid spyware turning on the webcam, recording you and sending the videos to hackers or NSA, just to mention two options.
Look for the webcam/video module:
$ lsmod
Always the main webcam module is: uvcvideo. List dependencies (correlations):
$ lsmod | grep uvcvideo
Remove the module from the kernel:
$ sudo rmmod uvcvideo
Verify that the module is out of the kernel: 
$ lsmod | grep uvcvideo
Notice the dependencies are not going to work because the module is down.
Remember the module name to load it to the kernel when you want to turn on the camera for a video conference:
$ insmod uvcvideo
The module has to be loaded:
$ lsmod | grep uvcvideo
The camera has to work right now:
$ lsusb
$ lspci
$ less /var/log/messages
$ lshw
$ guvcview

- Cover the lens with tape

This is a extreme security measure, but I think that setting off the video module is sufficient.
