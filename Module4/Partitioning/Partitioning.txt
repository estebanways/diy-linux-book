To work on partitions and more:
The tool I like the most is Gparted, but also you can use fdisk, and Disks:
To install Gparted:
Need to setup repos main, contrib and non-free to install NTFS package ntfs-3g:
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gparted
Note: To work on the active primary partition you can boot up the computer from a distro like Knoppix, which is Live DVD and also has a Gparted out of the Box.


To use fsck since Gparted:
To check the file system on your Ubuntu partition...
boot to the GRUB menu.
choose Advanced Options.
choose Recovery mode.
choose Root access.
at the # prompt, type sudo fsck -f / or sudo fsck -f /dev/sda1.
repeat the fsck command if there were errors.
type reboot.
