(This is what DebianInstaller would have installed in a new system, but you might want/need to uninstall the current display manager). 

The appearance of GTK-applications in Plasma:
---------------------------------------------

To get gtk-applications look native in Plasma you need install these packages and configure appearance of them through System Settings > Application appearance:

kde-config-gtk-style. KDE configuration module for GTK+ 2/3.x style selection
kde-config-gtk-style-preview.
gtk2-engines-oxygen. Oxygen widget theme for GTK2+-based applications
gtk3-engines-oxygen. Oxygen widget theme for GTK3+-based applications (Debian Wheezy) 

Restore my KDE Plasma desktop to default
----------------------------------------

$ mv ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc-old

Log out of KDE and log back in.

To install the Wayland support:
-------------------------------

Wayland is a replacement for the X11 window system protocol and architecture with the aim to be easier to develop, extend, and maintain.

$ sudo nala search plasma-workspace

$ sudo nala install plasma-workspace-wayland

LightDM is a free and open-source X display manager that aims to be lightweight, fast, extensible and multi-desktop. It can use various front-ends to draw the user interface,[6] also called Greeters. It also supports Wayland.

$ sudo nala install lightdm

$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm

Choose Lightdm as the display manager.

Close and choose KDE (Plasma) from the LightDM menu to start a Wayland session instead of a X Server session.

To verify that you are using Wayland in the system:
Search for "About" in the applications search field.
Open the kDE application About the Sysstem.
You will see the next in the list of sofware:
Graphics Platform: Wayland.

To verify that any KDE application is running on Wayland.
Go to the menu About of the application.
Go to the tab components.
Scroll down and you will see teh message: "The wayland windowing system."

Non KDE applications could be verified in different ways.
Some would required to download or build a versions with Wayland support, additionally.
