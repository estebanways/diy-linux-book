Issues:
Xbaclight does not work in all laptops.

Cairo-Dock:
For the brightness adjustment to work you require Gnome Desktop or Xbacklight, but if they won't work try installing Cairo-dock app and when the apps dock is ready make right click on it, and then go to menu configure and then add Luminosity. Luminosity is going to change the screen Brightness not only in Laptops but also in Desktop computers.
