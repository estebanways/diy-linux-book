The video card of the computer was recognized by the Debian Jessie installation, but what about the acceleration, is it working, and if yes how well? The Desktop shows some transparencies like the give by managers like xcompmgr but I am not sure.. Is all the GPU power turned on?

I have installed previously Wheezy on this computer and noted that I could not see
the new Gnome 3 desktop effects.. it looked different. Gnome 3 looks pretty much like Ubuntu's Unity. At that point I realized that
my video card was not configured and here is exactly what I did:

I know that my video card is ATI so I need ATI driver. If you have an Nvidia card and drivers are not installed this section is not going to be useful for you and have to find the answer on the web.

Steps to install the ATI or Nvidia drivers.

To check the video hardware:
$ lspci
$ lspci | grep 'ATI'

To verify rendering is on:
$ glxinfo
$ glxinfo | grep 'rendering'
Output says:
direct rendering: Yes

But according to this script from: http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=31192
I am using VESA Driver and it is not capable of running for example Compiz (The window manager with the 3Dcube). I am not going to continue install Compiz because has many bugs and will be deprecated since Ubuntu, and I have the new Gnome 3 interface, but I guess I have the default or free version of the video driver instead of the newest or proprietary version (See /etc/apt/sources.list).

I downloaded the script and gave it the name Check-VideoAcceleration.sh

Run the script like this:
$ sh Check-VideoAcceleration.sh

Would you like to know more? (Y/n) y

 The vesa driver is not capable of running Compiz, you need to install
 the proper driver for your graphics card. 

To install the proprietary drivers:
I went to search on google: 'install amd drivers debian 8'
I reached the site: https://wiki.debian.org/ATIProprietary

Follow these steps:
From a copy of the section of the page for Jessie:

Debian 8 "Jessie"

AMD Catalyst 14.9

For support of Radeon R9 200, Radeon R7 200, Radeon HD 8000, Radeon HD 7000, Radeon HD 6000 and Radeon HD 5000 series GPUs (supported devices).

<!> This driver is incompatible with the GNOME desktop, as it does not support the EGL interface. It is recommended to use the free radeon driver instead.

Backup the file /etc/apt/sources.list
# cp -dpR /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.listBAK
Add "contrib" and "non-free" components to /etc/apt/sources.list:

# Debian 8 "Jessie"
# Packages: ATI Drivers, 
deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free

Update the list of available packages:
# apt-get update

Install the appropriate linux-headers and fglrx-driver packages:
# aptitude -r install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,') fglrx-driver

This will also install the recommended fglrx-modules-dkms package. DKMS will build the fglrx module for your system.

Output:
This system has a graphics card which is no longer handled by the Fglrx    
 driver (package fglrx-driver). You may wish to keep the package            
  installed - for instance to drive some other card - but the card with      
  the following chipset won't be usable:

  [AMD/ATI] RS880M [Mobility Radeon HD 4225/4250] [1002:9712]                 
                                                                              
  The above card requires either the non-free legacy Fglrx driver (package    
  fglrx-legacy-driver) or the free Radeon driver (package                     
  xserver-xorg-video-radeon).                                                 
                                                                              
 Before the Radeon driver can be used you must remove Fglrx configuration  
  from xorg.conf (and xorg.conf.d/).  

I pressed on [OK] button and the terminal shows another dialog:

Install Fglrx driver despite unsupported graphics card?
                                                             
 [Yes]                  [No]  
I pressed [No]
Search the the non-free legacy Fglrx driver (package fglrx-legacy-driver) or the free Radeon driver (package xserver-xorg-video-radeon):
# apt-cache search 'fglrx-legacy-driver'
No package is available to retrieve and at least the file sources.list has active the contributions (contrib) and proprietary packages (non-free) in the line repo added recently:
# Debian 8 "Jessie"
# Packages: ATI drivers,
deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free

I gooogled and find that other people have the same problem.

I try to find the another package from the installation message: xserver-xorg-video-radeon.
Here is the compatibility card list:
Web: https://wiki.debian.org/AtiHowTo


There I find how to install xserver-xorg-video-radeon:

AMD/ATI Open Source Drivers (radeon, r128, mach64):

Identification:
The AMD/ATI graphics processing unit (GPU) series/codename of an installed video card can usually be identified using the lspci command.
# lspci -nn | grep VGA
Output:

Installation:
The following procedure will install the open source display driver packages, DRI modules (for 3D acceleration) and driver firmware/microcode:

    Add "contrib" and "non-free" components to /etc/apt/sources.list, for example:

    # Debian 8 "Jessie"
    deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free

    Update the list of available packages:

    # apt-get update

    Install the firmware-linux-nonfree, libgl1-mesa-dri and xserver-xorg-video-ati packages:

    # apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-video-ati


Update Note: 
In a new AMD64 Debian Stretch Linux which supports newer cards, next is the output showing all the packages to be install automatically.
Output:

                         [Yes]                  [No] 

This time I hit [yes]

The installation says:

...but continues ans finishes.

Again I install the xserver-xorg-video-radeon:
# apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-video-ati

Output:

Restart your system to load GPU device firmware:
# reboot
Or with systemd:
# systemctl reboot

Troubleshooting:
Use of firmware/microcode used by the radeon DRM driver can be verified using the dmesg command. For example:

$ dmesg | grep -E 'drm|radeon' | grep -iE 'firmware|microcode'

If files were unable to be loaded, ensure the firmware-linux-nonfree package is installed (refer to Installation). 

Screen flickering with Adobe Flash: see FlashPlayer#flickering. 

Configuration:
In most cases, manual configuration for the open source display drivers is not required, as the Xorg X server automatically detects and configures available hardware.

The following optional configuration can be used to increase 3D performance. See the xorg.conf(5) and radeon(4) manual pages for more information.

At this point I require to see before continue the installation:
Reference: 
Web: http://manpages.debian.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?sektion=5&query=xorg.conf&apropos=0&manpath=sid&locale=en
File: xorg configuration.pdf

The file is too large so I am not going to paste the text here, In summary at the beginning says that as user you can find the Xorg xserver configuration files under /etc/ but the files available depending on your user level. Also says that the xserver looks for the configuration files in order and the configuration can be overwritten depending on where you added your personal configuration. As root I went to:
# cd /etc/X11
# ls -F
The only file ending with .cong is Xwrapper.config, but it says I can run '# dpkg-reconfigure x11-common' to configure X server. The root is the only who can run dpkg; maybe users with sudo (but it is not configured yet) can do it.

# dpkg-reconfigure x11-common

The program opens dialog with three options:

Users allowed to start the X server:                                      
                                                                            
                             Root Only                                        
                             Console Users Only                              
                             Anybody   

I have chosen Anybody, but the program shows an error.
Output:
update-rc.d: warning: start and stop actions are no longer supported; falling back to defaults

This problem is maybe related to the new systemd and I am investigating this matter.
To list all the services with systemd:
# systemctl

To locate the file xorg.conf:
# locate
Output:

There isn't any .conf file to edit or a template to create/modify a version of /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
Update Note: 
10-amdgpu.conf: The file has configuration a configuration "Section". Use its content information in case of acceleration modifications.
Output:

        Identifier "AMDgpu"
        MatchDriver "amdgpu"
        Driver "amdgpu"
EndSection
End of Output.
End of Update Note.

I went back to check the configuration file:
https://wiki.debian.org/ATIProprietary
to this section:
https://wiki.debian.org/ATIProprietary#configure

The section says that the configuration file has to be created.
The web page says that the file is not required the most of times. I think everything is already configured but I am not sure yet because the web also says: 'As the fglrx driver is not autodetected by Xorg, a configuration file is required to be supplied.'

Anyway the file should help, because the ATI Web says: "optional configuration can be used to increase 3D performance. See the xorg.conf(5) and radeon(4) manual pages for more information."

To create an Xorg server configuration directory and file:

# mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
# echo -e 'Section "Device"\n\tIdentifier "My GPU"\n\tDriver "fglrx"\nEndSection' > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-fglrx.conf

The basic file will look like this:

/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-fglrx.conf

    Section "Device"
            Identifier "My GPU"
            Driver "fglrx"
    EndSection


But the ATI Web page shows the performance information to include in the file:
Reference:
Web: https://wiki.debian.org/AtiHowTo
File: AMD - ATI Open Source Drivers.pdf

Open the file to edit the first section and add the rest of the lines:
# nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-fglrx.conf


The basic version will look like this:


Section "Device"
 Driver "radeon"
 Identifier "My GPU"
 Option "AccelMethod" "XAA"
 # XAA/EXA
 Option "AccelDFS"    "1"
 # 1/0 On for PCIE, off for AGP

To test the performance I will use Mesa.
Reference: 
Web: https://wiki.debian.org/Mesa#Testingperformance
File: Performance test with Mesa.pdf

To install Mesa:
# apt-get update
# apt-get install mesa-utils

Among the mesa tools, glxinfo will help you to know more about the chip that your computer uses. The command:
$ glxinfo | grep OpenGL
My Output:
OpenGL vendor string: X.Org
OpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on AMD RS880
OpenGL core profile version string: 3.3 (Core Profile) Mesa 10.3.2
OpenGL core profile shading language version string: 3.30
OpenGL core profile context flags: (none)
OpenGL core profile profile mask: core profile
OpenGL core profile extensions:
OpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 10.3.2
OpenGL shading language version string: 1.30
OpenGL context flags: (none)
OpenGL extensions:
OpenGL ES profile version string: OpenGL ES 3.0 Mesa 10.3.2
OpenGL ES profile shading language version string: OpenGL ES GLSL ES 3.0
OpenGL ES profile extensions:

If in the OpenGL renderer string: you see llvmpipe, that means your system doesn't use the GPU but the CPU instead to render the computer graphics. If you want to use the GPU look at the Graphics Card page. Many times you just need to install the firmware-linux-nonfree package from the non-free repositories, in order to active the driver. 

3D Acceleration:
To determine whether 3D acceleration is working, use the glxinfo tool. Run the following command:
$ glxinfo  | grep rendering
The output should be and is:
direct rendering: Yes

Testing performance:
To see how many frames per second your video card is putting out, run the following command:
$ glxgears -info

You should see the windows with the gears animation and and output with information.
My Output:
Running synchronized to the vertical refresh.  The framerate should be
approximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.

The program open the Gallium Window (Direct rendering preferences)

Note on Window options:
OpenGL Shading Language (abbreviated: GLSL or GLslang), is a high-level shading language based on the syntax of the C programming language. It was created by the OpenGL ARB (OpenGL Architecture Review Board) to give developers more direct control of the graphics pipeline without having to use ARB assembly language or hardware-specific languages.
Web: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language
Picture: Linux_kernel_and_OpenGL_video_games.svg

Warning: Take care with the options.. you could overheat the card and burn it!

Also is recommended to verify the permissions of the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-fglrx.conf, but I guess that they are ok and the LibGL error is not because of the permissions.

Important: When using free version of the driver, the file should be or must be created here:
/etx/X11/xorg.conf

To Answer the  Questions:
It doesn't work. I don't have rendering, and I can't tell why.
When I startx, I get this error: "[drm] failed to load kernel module agpgart"
I have a Radeon, and I want TV-Out.
It doesn't work. My card is so incredibly new and cool that it isn't supported at all.
I have a PCI card and it doesn't work. Help!

A big old example of the .conf file:
https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=46681

To regenerate /etc/X11/xorg.conf (But at this point you'd better edit the existent with nano or backup the file before proceed):
Stop x server and try:
# Xorg --configure

You can locate files you thing you don't have like this (An example):
$ locate r600_dri.so
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri/r600_dri.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/r600_dri.so

Final tips:
You should enable the hardware acceleration in your browsers. You can test it in many ways.

Test 3D+DRI:
Use your Steam account to buy Half Life or download Half Life from:
https://mega.co.nz/#F!FRoQBISY!uSKJuc_pq-51TSyTnMt_-Q
Thanks to: https://inukaze.wordpress.com/

Extract the files and:
# cp -dpR HalfLife1EE/ /usr/src
Change permissions as user esteban:
# cd /usr/src
# chmod 777 HalfLife1EE
# chown esteban HalfLife1EE
# chgrp esteban HalfLife1EE
Run the scrip to setup the game:
# sh Configurar_en_POSIX_HalfLifeEE
Message: "Se ha configurado correctamente"
And terminal Output is something like: 
Se utilizara la version de wine : 1.7.29
Lanzar Half Life:
$  sh LanzarHLEE
$  sh LanzarHLEE -windowed
Wine is going to update and start the game.

But the game is not working.
There is another script to run like LanzarHLEE to clean up the system from Wine and delete the game icons from.

I installed extremetuxracer since synaptic (to test 3d at least) and works.

At this point I have found new options to modify # nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-fglrx.conf. I am going to modify the file and show a newer version.

# nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-fglrx.conf

Notes about the file:
Option	"AccelMethod"           "glamor"
Glamour is the newest Accel type but requires sections:
Section "DRI"
Section "Modules"
The rest of options seems to be fine but yours not necessarily.


I have installed the game Crack Attack and is working fine.
It is a multiplayer OpenGL puzzle game like "Tetris Attack"
Crack Attack is very slow without hardware acceleration.  For Xorg
users, this means you want DRI.
Install Crack Attack since synaptic software manager.

I also installed Trigger Rally:
Trigger is a free 3D rally car racing game. Fun for all the family!
System Requirements consist of an OpenGL accelerated video card.

I also installed Supertuxkart:
# apt-get update
# apt-get install supertuxkart

To look for more games you can do like this:
# apt-get update
# apt-cache search 'arena'
# apt-get install openarena
# where is openarena
Output:
openarena: /usr/lib/openarena /usr/games/openarena /usr/share/man/man6/openarena.6.gz
So to play enter:
$ openarena
dpkg -l | grep 'openarena'
ii  openarena                             0.8.8-9

There are graphical options, for example to Gnome users:
Gnome-shell-extension-Radeon-Power-Profile-Manager. It'a extension to change the profile of the potency of the radeon card when we use the open source controller (driver):
gnome-shell-extension-radeon-power-profile-manager-git:

gnome-shell-extension-radeon-ppm:

Check TV output and more here:
Reference (Spanish):
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ATI_%28Espa%C3%B1ol%29

To setup the power profile:
Web: https://github.com/StuntsPT/shell-extension-radeon-power-profile-manager
File:
The first thing to do is to Download the file from the GIT repository.
Package: shell-extension-radeon-power-profile-manager-master.zip
Extract the package.
According to the Official Gnome extensions site and Debian Wiki the best way to add a extension is to use the Gnome Tweak tool from the section extensions, but the extension is a Zip file from GitHub and when I added from the tools nothing happens.
I will follow the instructions in the GitHub, that are also in the extracted file README.md.
Here is a modified copy of the Usage instructions:
To use this extension you need:
A Radeon card that supports power profiles - r1xx and up;
To be running the open source drivers;
Make sure that /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method is set to profile;
Before make the optional step I am going to backup the file to remember the default permissions:
# cp -dpR power_profile power_profileBAK
Curiously I cannot copy the filename, maybe because the card is on but here is an output of the original permissions to restore them in case of something fails:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4.0K May 17 18:19 power_profile
And the content of the file is one line which says "default".
Optional:
Set the permissions of /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile to be writable by your user (by default only root can change these values);
chmod a+w /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile will work, but feel free to use any other method;
The new permissions should be:
Output:
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 4.0K May 17 18:19 power_profile
to make the changes permanent don't forget to add the chmod line to your rc.local or equivalent in your distro (If your /etc/rc.local contains an exit 0 line, then the chmod line has to be placed before it);
if you are using systemd, you can create /etc/tmpfiles.d/radeon-power-profile.conf with the following line:
w /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile 0666 - - - mid;
this will change the permissions of power_profile so that any user can change the profile;
If you do not do this, the extension will attempt to use polkit and ask for your password every time you change the profile.

At this point I don't see any extension.
I want to download extensions with the browser. Here is the troubleshooting from the Gnome site:
https://extensions.gnome.org/about/#no-detection
To find out more Gnome extensions go to:
https://extensions.gnome.org/
What I do is to active the Gnome Shell Integration plug-in in the browser with the Add-ons Manager.

I restarted the computer check the Gnome extensions page and says that the extension is 'Outdated' but I finally could set it to ON no the web site.
I double-checked the extension in the Gnome Tweak Center and I could set it to ON (Must say ON in light blue instead of OFF).
To turn on and off Gnome extensions, use the Gnome Tweak Tool:
$ gnome-tweak-tool
After that you see the extension on the top in the black system bar next to the keyboard configuration.
Click to display the menu and choose a profile.
The system will display a prompt windows with a message to enter the administrator password. I am not going to read more the readme.md nor Github manual the password step to users but go ahead, if you will.
I don't note a difference between profiles but is a good option for laptops to save battery energy. There was another tool in the official repo, I saw it from Synaptic but it was only for laptops and the app description said it could damage the hardware. I tested the profiles with the programs redeontop and glxgears.
