List groups:
# grep group_name_here /etc/group
# vim /etc/group

Add users to group staff (example using xcapncrunchx), and See Which Group Your Linux User Belongs To:

List groups and users in specific group:
# nano /etc/group
To search for esteban in nano:
CTRL + W amd type esteban.
OR use:
# grep staff /etc/group
# grep xcapncrunchx /etc/group

Print the groups a user is in. The first group in teh list is the "default" or "main" user group:
# groups
OR:
# groups username

$ id -Gn esteban
To know the id numbers:
$ id

Remove user from group, and See Which Group Your Linux User Belongs To:
# deluser user group

Give permissions to the file:
# chmod 755 mysql-cluster-gpl-7.2.10-linux2.6-i686.tar.gz
# chown root mysql-cluster-gpl-7.2.10-linux2.6-i686.tar.gz
# chgrp staff mysql-cluster-gpl-7.2.10-linux2.6-i686.tar.gz

Untar the file:
# cd /usr/local/
# tar xvzf mysql-cluster-gpl-7.2.10-linux2.6-i686.tar.gz
The folder permissions are automatically set to owner: root and group: staff.


- Terminals

Clear the terminal:
# clean
Reset the terminal:
# reset
Restore lost remote terminal sessions through ssh:
# apt-get install screen
I am not showing how to use screen. It's kind of complicated to understand it the first time you use it, but.. do it yourself.
Run screen to open a new terminal session:
# screen <parameters>

Install Matrix like terminal fall:
# apt-get update
# apt-get install cmatrix
Run with:
$ cmatrix

Change font color:
Just edit your terminal profile:
gnome-terminal: Edit -> Profiles -> Edit
Uncheck option: Use colors from system theme.
konsole: Settings -> Configure Profiles

Open a new Xterm with green font:
$ xterm -foreground green

Setup all the Xterm (instead of gnome-terminal) as green
on black:
Create the file:

/home/esteban/.Xresorces

!
! Comments begin with a "!" character.
!

XTerm*background:       black
XTerm*foreground:       green
XTerm*cursorColor:      green
XTerm.vt100.geometry:   79x25
XTerm*scrollBar:        true
XTerm*scrollTtyOutput:  false


or use this:
!
! Comments begin with a "!" character.
!

XTerm*Background: black
XTerm*Foreground: green
XTerm*transparent: true
XTerm*font: 9x15
XTerm*saveLines: 1000
XTerm*HiForeColor: white
XTerm*HiBackColor: #c06077
XTerm*geometry: 79x25

Next, XResources are read from the file ~/.Xresources when you login, but if you wish to force them to be reloaded you run the command:
$ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

Set Xterm geometry:
$ Xterm -geometry 40x20

Xterm transparency:
Reference:
Topic: According to this article you cannot set transparency in Xterm.
Web: http://forums.justlinux.com/showthread.php?110791-xterm-transparency
The article says that you need eterm or aterm.
To install Eterm:
# apt-get install Xterm
To run a term:
# Eterm -X buttonbar=off --scrollbar=off -f blue
To run a Eterm with transparency:
# Eterm -X buttonbar=off --scrollbar=off -f blue --trans true

Note: With this types of terminal you don't need to
install gnome at all except for when there is a dependency
problem, for example if gimp needs gnome to run, but you can
install just x server xorg without gnome. I have installed
gnome but as I don't enter to gnome desktop I save RAM memory to other apps, but I spend memory when I call Nautilus so it is better to use rox instead.

I don't like Eterm but here are more config options:
Reference:
Web: http://www.brain-dump.org/blog/entry/38/Fluxbox_startup_techniques_and_transparent_Eterm_on_desktop
File: Etermconfig.pdf
For example here you can define the layer number of the terminals in a very simple way. This can work if you RIGHT CLICK MENU >  remember... the size and position of a term with fluxbox so that the next time when you start the system will look like waking up from hibernation and ordered.

Install aterm:
Aterm is teh best option because appears transparent by default, but I am not sure at this point if uses the file      .XResources. Anyways keep the file and remember to reload the configuration just in case:
# apt-get update
# apt-get install aterm
# aterm
# xrdb -merge ~./Xresources

Make aterm work with [group] and add the app to replace gnome-terminal in [app] of the file apps and ad it to file menu in fluxbox if you want. In my opinion the term group looks bad and preferred to keep using gnome terminal but that is better to save resources. But in gnome terminal you can paste commands and on the other terms you cannot (Reminds me Windows).

You can see aterm and Eterm in the Fluxbox term menu. For fluxbox information see the Fluxbox guide.
