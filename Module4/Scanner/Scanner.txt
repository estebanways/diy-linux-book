The scanner worked out of the box in Debian Wheezy and Jessie. 
I re-installed the Cups driver manually instead of the Default Epson driver installed by default this time by Gnome in Jessie.

To open the scanner:
# simple-scan 

If you have problems with the scanner you can use:
# sane-find-scanner
Example of Output when something goes wrong:

  # sane-find-scanner will now attempt to detect your scanner. If the
  # result is different from what you expected, first make sure your
  # scanner is powered up and properly connected to your computer.

  # No SCSI scanners found. If you expected something different, make sure that
  # you have loaded a kernel SCSI driver for your SCSI adapter.

found USB scanner (vendor=0x04b8, product=0x083a) at libusb:001:007
  # Your USB scanner was (probably) detected. It may or may not be supported by
  # SANE. Try scanimage -L and read the backend's manpage.

  # Not checking for parallel port scanners.

  # Most Scanners connected to the parallel port or other proprietary ports
  # can't be detected by this program.

No scanners were identified. If you were expecting something different,
check that the scanner is plugged in, turned on and detected by the
sane-find-scanner tool (if appropriate). Please read the documentation
which came with this software (README, FAQ, manpages).

Or you can try with scanimage but with a non-working scanner nothing is going to happen.
# scanimage -L

Are you still running in troubles?, start googling and visit the Debian Wiki.
